Version 6.3 - 08 oct 2012
New Features:
- Added a new startup task to setup and configure the localhost SMTP server on the webroles. Now you can use
LOCALHOST as SMTP server without the need of using a 3rd party SMTP server
- Added "post-install" addons feature: if an url pointing to a .zip file is specified in the service configuration 
file, after the successful start of the SMB server the .zip file will be downloaded and decompressed into the 
DotNetNuke folder maintaining the same files and folder architecture and overwriting contents. This is an useful 
feature to add in an automated way 3rd party files, dependencies, etc. to a DotNetNuke clean install. Use it as 
you wish.
- Added SSL binding support: the Accelerator wizard does not include a step to setup this yet, but the work is 
done in the package. To manually setup SSL on your service configuration file, please read this thread 
http://dnnazureaccelerator.codeplex.com/discussions/359504
- Added Web Platform Installer support: a new startup task has been added to enable WebPI products installations
and dependencies, like MVC3, WebDeploy, etc. 
- Added WebDeploy support: a new checkbox has been added in the Remote Desktop setup step, in order to enable
WebDeploy. Using the new Web Plaform Installer feature, with Web Deploy enabled (note that enabling this feature 
takes about 10 more minutes for the VM deployment), you can access to your site using tools like WebMatrix or other 
command line tools like WebDeploy's command line utility, in order to copy or modify files or create your own backups.

Fixes:
- Changed the way to import the publish settings file: discontinued the automatic download while refreshing the 
subscription data, you have to manually download and import the file in the wizard. 
- The packages are using the latest Azure SDK 1.7 (June 2012)
- Fixed the packageUrl on the SMB package
- Fixed references to use latest versions
- Fixed an issue causing the "fileshare" user's password being expired after a month
- Fixed an issue on the wizard's verification step while deploying ("No deployments were found")

Version 6.2 - 30 may 2012
General
- Modified the local file sharing user account creation on roles to don't allow account expiration
- Modified the web roles endpoints to allow traffic on port 443
- Changed the package unzip operations to use managed code (ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll)
- Use of "netsh advfirewall firewall" to allow traffic on the SMB server (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947709/)
- Automatic adition of "IsWebFarm" app setting in the web.config file to enable the FileCachingProvider 
- Automatic download of the latest available CE package from CodePlex on first run (Beta feature). Also you can overwrite
the "packageUrl" setting to download from any other customized location, like previous Azure Storage container locations or any other.
- Changed the Azure diagnostic monitor initialization. Now the events are being correctly logged on web roles.
- Extra packages has been moved to a separated download. The wizard comes with the "Azure Single and Small" package so 
the DNNAzureAccelerator package only weights 4Mb. 
- Changed the default binding. The default website will be the DotNetNuke website instead of the webrole website, what means
that specifying host headers is no longer mandatory, and enables the possibility of deploying on Staging environment and other 
operations like Swap VIP
- Now on role startup, the database and login user will be created if the database does not exist. This will make easier to create
new DNN service deployments by simply changing the service configuration file without having to do that task manually or through the 
accelerator wizard.
- Added new deployment progress page on the webrole website, showing the service deployment status until the site is ready. By default,
the deployment log stored on Table Storage is not shown on this page, but you can enable it on the service configuration file for
debugging purposes. You can access these details using remote desktop on any webrole and browsing "http://admin.dnndev.me".
- Wizard redesigned adding steps for automatic provisioning and deployment, allowing to provision hosted services, storage accounts, 
SQL Azure server, firewall rules, etc. 
- Added an option on the Wizard to do an automatic installation with default parameters. Remember that default credentials are user
"host" with password "dnnhost", change that credentials as soon as possible
- Added an option on the Wizard to export to a local system folder for later deployment
- 32bit compiled modules now work
- Added configuration settings in the service configuration file to customize some application pool timeout limits to allow to deploy 
and install successfully on ExtraSmall instances
- Added a new configuration setting to specify a custom install configuration file to overwrite the default installation 
"Install/DotNetNuke.install.config"

Version 6.1 - 02 nov 2011
