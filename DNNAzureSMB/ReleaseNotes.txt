Version 6.2 - 30 may 2012
General
- Modified the local file sharing user account creation on roles to don't allow account expiration
- Modified the web roles endpoints to allow traffic on port 443
- Changed the package unzip operations to use managed code (ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll)
- Use of "netsh advfirewall firewall" to allow traffic on the SMB server (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947709/)
- Automatic adition of "IsWebFarm" app setting in the web.config file to enable the FileCachingProvider 
- Automatic download of the latest available CE package from CodePlex on first run (Beta feature). Also you can overwrite
the "packageUrl" setting to download from any other customized location, like previous Azure Storage container locations or any other.
- Changed the Azure diagnostic monitor initialization. Now the events are being correctly logged on web roles.
- Extra packages has been moved to a separated download. The wizard comes with the "Azure Single and Small" package so 
the DNNAzureAccelerator package only weights 4Mb. 
- Changed the default binding. The default website will be the DotNetNuke website instead of the webrole website, what means
that specifying host headers is no longer mandatory, and enables the possibility of deploying on Staging environment and other 
operations like Swap VIP
- Now on role startup, the database and login user will be created if the database does not exist. This will make easier to create
new DNN service deployments by simply changing the service configuration file without having to do that task manually or through the 
accelerator wizard.
- Added new deployment progress page on the webrole website, showing the service deployment status until the site is ready. By default,
the deployment log stored on Table Storage is not shown on this page, but you can enable it on the service configuration file for
debugging purposes. You can access these details using remote desktop on any webrole and browsing "http://admin.dnndev.me".
- Wizard redesigned adding steps for automatic provisioning and deployment, allowing to provision hosted services, storage accounts, 
SQL Azure server, firewall rules, etc. 
- Added an option on the Wizard to do an automatic installation with default parameters. Remember that default credentials are user
"host" with password "dnnhost", change that credentials as soon as possible
- Added an option on the Wizard to export to a local system folder for later deployment
- 32bit compiled modules now work
- Added configuration settings in the service configuration file to customize some application pool timeout limits to allow to deploy 
and install successfully on ExtraSmall instances
- Added a new configuration setting to specify a custom install configuration file to overwrite the default installation 
"Install/DotNetNuke.install.config"
