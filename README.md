Enables the creation of new&nbsp;DNN host instances from on-premise to the cloud using a wizard that guides you on this process, creating the SQL Azure database, uploading the solution engine and associated service configurations.</p><p>The wizard also <strong>automates the provision of resources required</strong> to deploy your DNN instance on Azure, from creating the required hosted service, storage account and database server. The deployment process ends with the latest&nbsp;DNN Platform&nbsp;installation downloaded directly from CodePlex. To get started, unzip the wizard package and start the DNNAzureWizard.exe.<strong>Review the Getting Started section</strong>.</p><p>The wizard comes with a package that deploys&nbsp;DNN Platform&nbsp;on Small sized instances (also included ExtraSmall, Medium and Large packages). You can increase or decrease the number of webroles that serves the DNN site. One of the webworkers will mount and share the VHD drive, and then all the webworkers will connect to the share.&nbsp;</p><p>A SMB package is also included where a SMB role is who mount and shares the drive. Both SMB worker role and webworkers can be deployed on High Availability.</p><p><br><img title="Scheme600.jpg" src="http://i3.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=dnnazureaccelerator&DownloadId=725262" alt="Scheme600.jpg"></p><h2>Getting Started with Windows Azure and DNN Platform</h2><p><a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/EntryId/3379/Getting-Started-with-Windows-Azure-and-DotNetNuke.aspx" target="_blank">Joe Brinkman has produced an&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;video tutorial</a>about how to deploy&nbsp;DNN Platform&nbsp;on Windows Azure using this accelerator.
